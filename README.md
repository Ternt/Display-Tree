# Display-Trie
A program I am working on while interning as a backend developer at a vietnamese company called Mobile World JSC. A while back I was tasked with writing a program to visualize data structures in a way that was easy to understand. Before, I was tasked with visualizing a perfect generic (k-ary) tree based on this problem[^1. But due to the change in data structure, I am now working with tries (prefix trees). 

Originally I wanted to make a really general program that can take in any pair of preorder and postorder list and build a tree out of it, no matter the type. That proved quite challenging and I currently I can't think of a solution to this. Also due to work, I had to change the program and implement something more specific, that being **tries** or **prefix trees**.
